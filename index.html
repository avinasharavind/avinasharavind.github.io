        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>My name is Avinash Aravind, I'm from Central NJ, and I study the weather. I'm currently a sophomore majoring 
            in Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, and I work on assorted projects
            related to our atmosphere (and others) when I get a chance. Some of those projects are
            featured on this site, so feel free to take a look around!
        </p>

        <p>If you're seeing this, this page is currently under development and should hopefully look a lot cleaner in a few weeks.</p>
