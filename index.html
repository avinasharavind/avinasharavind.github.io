        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p><i>My name is Avinash Aravind, I'm from Central NJ, and I study the weather. I'm currently a sophomore majoring 
            in Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, and I work on assorted projects
            related to our atmosphere (and others) when I get a chance. Some of those projects are
            featured on this site, so feel free to take a look around!

            building it, so please come back in a few days to find more here! I'm hoping to finish this by the
            end of the year; it should look a lot cleaner by then.</b>
