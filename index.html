        <h1>Avinash's Weather Page</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Avinash Aravind and I study the weather. I'm currently a sophomore majoring 
            in Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University, and I work on assorted projects
            related to our atmosphere (and others) when I get a chance. Some of those projects are
            featured on this site, so feel free to take a look around!
        </p>

        <p>I'm intrigued by pretty much any and all weather phenomena, but some particulars include:</p>

                <li>TC Formation and environmental conditions</li>
                <li>Eyewall Replacement Cycles and inner core structure</li>
