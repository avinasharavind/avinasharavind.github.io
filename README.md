Hi! My name is Avinash, and I study the weather and occasionally make cool things related to our atmosphere.
Those cool things occasionally end up on my website, which is linked above.

This repo holds the files for the main page of my website.
There's not much else here, but you're welcome to visit the website to learn more about me or check out
some of the stuff I've made!
