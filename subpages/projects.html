        <p> What I spent most of my Summer 2024 on. The Weather Dashboard uses the wonderful National Weather Service API to pull 
            forecast information for any location in the US, and display it in a fun and interactive way. The inspiration came from my own
            issues with the weather.gov forecast page, which presents more information than other weather sites but in a less intuitive way.
            The version of the weather dashboard linked above is a static version hosted on GitHub Pages to display its capabilities.
            I have a personal version running on a Raspberry Pi server, but due to limitations I can only allow access to anyone else on the same
            IP (in this case, anyone on the Cornell WiFi). The code is publicly available, so feel free to run it yourself for your local area! 
            Leave a comment on the repo or shoot me an email if you need help setting it up.

            This one has been in the design stage for a while, but the idea is to use a similar approach to the dashboard for a physical decorative 
            object for my room. At the end of last year, I got access to the Cornell Makerspace, and so the plan with this project is to use the space's laser cutter
            to create a custom wooden board with spots for LEDs. These LEDs would be wired, eventually, to the aforementioned Raspberry Pi that can 
            then pull parsed METARs from the Aviation Weather Center API and light up the correct LEDs to display current temperature, wind, cloud cover, 
            and present weather. Hopefully will find the time to actually start building this soon.

            This website! About time I finally made one for myself.
